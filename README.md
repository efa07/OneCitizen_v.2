## üß† Project Overview

### üö® Problem Statement

Accessing government services in Ethiopia often involves:
- **Long queues** and mandatory physical visits to Woreda/Kebele offices
- **Paper-based records** prone to loss, duplication, or errors
- **No unified digital platform** for citizen-government interactions
- **Limited transparency** in tracking service request statuses

These inefficiencies lead to **delayed services**, **citizen frustration**, and **administrative bottlenecks**.

### üí° Solution: OneCitizen

**OneCitizen** is a centralized digital platform designed to:
- Authenticate citizens securely using **Fayda National ID**
- Provide access to a wide range of digital government services (e.g., birth certificates, land records)
- Enable **real-time tracking** of service request statuses
- Offer a **backend portal** for government administrators to manage requests efficiently

By integrating Fayda, OneCitizen ensures **trust**, **privacy**, and **transparency** through role-based access and secure identity verification.

## üîß Core System Modules

### 1. Citizen Profile System
- Syncs key profile data from Fayda National ID
- Stores local user records tied to a unique Fayda UUID
- Allows editable fields like contact info and preferred language

### 2. Service Directory
- Lists all available government services with details (title, description, type, department, status)
- Organizes services into categories (e.g., Health, Legal, Transport)

### 3. Service Request System
- Enables citizens to submit service requests (e.g., land ownership certificate)
- Tracks request statuses: **Pending ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed**
- Allows admins to assign, review, and complete requests

### 4. Role-Based Dashboards
- **Citizen**: View personal data and request statuses
- **Admin (Department-Specific)**: Manage incoming requests
- **SuperAdmin**: Oversee users, departments, and system settings

### 5. Audit Logs & Notifications
- Logs all actions for transparency and accountability
- Sends real-time status updates to citizens via notifications

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

By the end of the hackathon, OneCitizen aims to:
- Deliver a **working prototype** of the unified digital portal
- Simulate **real-world government service workflows**
- Demonstrate **Fayda integration** for secure authentication
- Lay the foundation for a scalable platform adoptable by the Ethiopian government

## ü™™ Fayda Integration

Fayda, Ethiopia‚Äôs National Digital ID system, is the **core enabler** of OneCitizen. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical:

- **Secure Authentication**: Citizens log in using their Fayda ID, ensuring verified access.
- **Tamper-Proof Identity**: Eliminates impersonation, fraud, and duplication.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Links all requests and transactions to a unique Fayda ID.
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Tracks every action, reducing corruption risks.
- **Government Alignment**: Fully supports Ethiopia‚Äôs digital transformation goals.

> **Why Fayda Matters**: Fayda isn‚Äôt just a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs the foundation of OneCitizen‚Äôs trust and scalability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Deployment

### üì¶ Local Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/onecitizen.git
   cd onecitizen
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
     ```bash
     cp server/.env.example server/.env
     ```
   - Update `.env` with credentials for Fayda, database, and JWT secrets.

4. **Start the Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally on port `5432`.

5. **Run the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npx prisma generate
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend**:
   In a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## üê≥ Docker Setup (Recommended for Deployment)

### 1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

 - Set up environment files:
   - Create server/.env and client/.env.local using provided .env.example files.
   - Make sure DATABASE_URL in server/.env uses the Docker PostgreSQL service:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://faydauser:faydapass@postgres:5432/faydadb
     ```
     
### 2. Build the Docker Image

If a `Dockerfile` exists in the repository root:

```bash
docker build -t onecitizen .
```

### 3. Run the Container

Replace `<options>` with any specific options your application may need (e.g., port mapping, environment variables):

```bash
docker run -d --name onecitizen_container -p 8000:8000 onecitizen
```

- Change `8000:8000` to the appropriate ports if your application uses a different one.

### 4. Using Docker Compose (Optional)

If a `docker-compose.yml` file is available, you can start the app and its dependencies with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

or (for older Docker versions):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 5. Access the Application

- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or the port specified in your setup).

## Customization

- Review the `.env.example` or `README` notes for environment variables and configuration options.
- To stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker stop onecitizen_container
docker rm onecitizen_container
```

Or, if using Compose:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Docker is running before building or starting containers.
- Check logs for errors:

```bash
docker logs onecitizen_container
```

- If you encounter permission issues, try running commands with `sudo` or adjust your Docker permissions.
